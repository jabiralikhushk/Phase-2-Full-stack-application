# Spec Constitution – Hackathon Todo App

## Authority
This project is governed strictly by Spec-Kit Plus.
Claude Code must follow all specs exactly.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- No manual coding by human
- No features beyond written specs
- No deviation from API contracts
- No skipping authentication
- No mixing phases

## Architecture Principles
- Monorepo architecture
- Frontend and backend separated
- Spec-driven development only
- Stateless backend authentication using JWT

## Security Rules
- All APIs require JWT
- User data isolation is mandatory
- Never expose secrets
- Use environment variables only

## Quality Standards
- Code must be runnable
- Minimal but complete implementation
- Explicit error handling
- REST conventions required

Breaking any rule invalidates the task.
