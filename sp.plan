- [COMPLETED] Establish Spec-Kit Plus structure
- [COMPLETED] Define project constitution with non-negotiable rules
- [COMPLETED] Create detailed specifications
- [COMPLETED] Plan implementation tasks
- [COMPLETED] Set up monorepo structure

#### Phase II: Implementation (Next Phase)
- [PENDING] Implement backend API with JWT authentication
- [PENDING] Implement user authentication endpoints
- [PENDING] Implement todo endpoints with JWT validation
- [PENDING] Implement frontend authentication UI
- [PENDING] Implement frontend todo UI with auth
- [PENDING] Set up shared utilities
- [PENDING] Integrate frontend and backend with auth

#### Phase III: Testing and Quality Assurance
