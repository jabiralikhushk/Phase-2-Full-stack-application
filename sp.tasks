### Task Dependencies
- Task 1 must be completed before Tasks 2 and 3
- Task 2 must be completed before Task 3
- Task 9 should be completed before Tasks 6, 7, and 8
- Tasks 1-4 should be completed before Task 8
- Task 10 depends on completion of Tasks 1-9

### Priority Levels
- P0: Critical functionality (auth API, JWT middleware, basic todo operations)
- P1: Important features (user data isolation, auth UI, protected routes)
- P2: Enhancement features (UI improvements, additional validation)
- P3: Nice-to-have (extra styling, advanced features)

### Success Criteria
- All authentication endpoints work correctly with JWT
- All todo endpoints require and validate JWT tokens
- User data isolation is enforced (users can only access their own data)
- Frontend successfully handles authentication flow
- All CRUD operations work with proper authentication
- Application is responsive on mobile and desktop
- All tests pass
- Code follows established patterns and standards
- Security requirements from constitution are met
